# Physical Picture of Electromagnetic Interaction under General Relativity Effects

Preliminary Exploration of the Electromagnetic Interaction Physical Picture

Preliminary Exploration of the Electromagnetic Interaction Physical Picture:
A GR Reformulation of Electromagnetic Interactions within the Quantized Elastic Spacetime Framework.
The following discussion may not be rigorous or entirely accurate but represents an attempt to describe the electromagnetic interaction within the framework of this model.

14.1 Electromagnetic Waves:
The SEQ resonance generates an electric field, which induces a spin magnetic moment orthogonal to the resonance direction. The phase of this magnetic moment aligns with the SEQ resonance phase. The SEQ resonance drives adjacent elastic bonds in the network. Given the model's assumption of symmetrically arranged elastic bonds around each SEQ, the resulting wave propagates spherically. Since the elastic bonds in the plane orthogonal to the resonance axis are more significantly perturbed, the transverse plane wave dominates.

The magnetic field of an electromagnetic wave fundamentally arises from the spatial twist (twistor) generated by SEQ spin. As noted in Chapter 1's foundational postulates, the twist induced by SEQ spin is decoupled from spatial elasticity. Thus, magnetic twist propagation relies on the electric field's propagation and cannot be mediated by sub-Planckian elastic components.

14.2 Closed Magnetic Fields of Charged Particles:
In this model, all charged particles possess a dynamic quasi-spherical structure composed of SEQ. The electric field diverges spherically, while the resonance axes of the SEQ within the structure radiate outward from the center. Since the magnetic field is orthogonal to the electric field, the induced magnetic field must form closed spherical surfaces. Macroscopically, this results in a closed magnetic field topology.

14.3 Spin-Generated Magnetic Moment Mechanism:
The twist-induced magnetic moment generated by the structural spin of charged particles and the SEQ spin magnetic moment are distinct concepts at different levels. Further work is needed to analyze the structural spin magnetic moment of charged particles.

14.4 Magnetic Field of Moving Charges:
In an electron's structure, SEQ are spherically distributed, with their resonance axes radiating from the center. The electron's motion introduces spatial deformation along its acceleration direction, which reduces the resonance frequency of SEQ. The frequency suppression is most pronounced when the SEQ resonance axis aligns with the acceleration direction (smaller angle), weakening the induced magnetic field.

Due to the electron's high velocity and acceleration, frequency modulation effects are highly significant. When the SEQ resonance axis is perpendicular to the acceleration direction, the deformation projection is minimized, preserving the magnetic field response. Thus, only SEQ with resonance axes orthogonal to the acceleration direction contribute dominantly to the observed magnetic field, resulting in a toroidal (ring-shaped) field around the motion direction.

14.5 Theoretical Integration:
This electromagnetic physical picture inherits the core ideas of Maxwell's vortex model while incorporating the SEQ framework. It synthesizes general relativistic effects and the metric-frequency mirror model, providing a microscopic explanation for electromagnetic wave generation and magnetic field formation within this paradigm.
